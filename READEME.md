# node-red-contrib-pid-complete

A node-red node to performe PID Calculations

# Getting started

## pid-complete node

### Input

1. msg.payload - must contain the input process variable (PV) unless a command is send.
2. msg.cmd - can contain 'reset', 'disable', 'auto', or 'manual'.

1. msg.payload - contains the output setpoint if in Auto or Manual.
2. msg.proportional - contains the output of the last proportional calculation.
3. msg.integral - contains the output of the last integral calculation.
4. msg.derivative - contains the output of the last derivative calculation.

### Configuration

| `Name`                   | What ever you name the node                                                  |
| `Calculation Interval`   | Time between calculations. Set longer for slow processes.                    |
| 'Min Output'             | Sets the lower range of the output calculation.                              |
| `Max Output`             | Sets the upper range of the output calculation.                              |

| `Ki`                     | Integral Gain.                                                               |
| `Kd`                     | Derivative Gain.                                                             |
| `SP`                     | Temperature Setpoint                                                         |   |
| 'Bump Percent'           | Output step as percent of setpoint for autotuning - In Progress              \
